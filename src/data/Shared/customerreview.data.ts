      "I recently travelled through Vietnam and was amazed by how delicious the Vietnamese coffee was from the very first cup. I came home and bought these Robusta beans and I have been able to recreate that delicious taste of the very first Vietnamese coffee I had there. Excellent service from the May crew too",

      "Wow. Absolutely love the chocolate note! Having just had Arabica before, I was a bit hesitant about this coffee. But the sound of caffeine in this little bag is absolutely incredible! A must have before hitting the gym everyday, great at keeping my energy level. Very bold, velvety smooth, great body coffee.",

    title: "Something for both of us",
    content: "We tried Honeymoon and Buffalo beans from May Coffee Crew. Hubby liked the strong buffalo, not at all phased by the strength, enjoying a double shot, while I preferred the smooth velvetiness of Honeymoon which seem to have a chocolatey hint about it. A premium coffee with a great backstory to win over the snobbiest of coffee snobs",
